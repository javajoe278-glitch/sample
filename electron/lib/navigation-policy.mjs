/**
 * Navigation and popup policy for the Electron shell.
 *
 * `window-url-policy.mjs` answers "what kind of URL is this?". This module
 * answers "what should the shell do when a window tries to go there?", for
 * the three entry points a renderer can reach:
 *
 *   - top-level navigation of a window (`will-navigate` / `will-redirect`),
 *   - `window.open()` from the main window (`setWindowOpenHandler`),
 *   - the OAuth popup, which is same-origin `about:blank` and therefore has
 *     all three of the above available to it in turn.
 *
 * The rules live here rather than inline in main.mjs so they can be tested
 * without launching Electron: every function takes the `openExternal`
 * implementation as an argument, and the window/webContents objects are used
 * only through `on()`, `setWindowOpenHandler()` and `close()`.
