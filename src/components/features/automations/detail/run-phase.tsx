 * accessible name on a focusable wrapper. Every surface nests this inside a
 * link — the activity log's `<a>`, the cards' `role="link"` — where a tab
 * stop is invalid interactive nesting, and Enter on it bubbled to the card
 * and navigated the user away from the text they were trying to read.
 * Truncation is CSS only, so the full label is already in the DOM and reads
